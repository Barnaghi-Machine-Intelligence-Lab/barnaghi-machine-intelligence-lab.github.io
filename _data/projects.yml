    Creating a 'Healthy Home' environment for people living with dementia.
    Prof Payam Barnaghi is combining engineering and technological innovation to produce a secure 'Healthy Home' system that will 
    incorporate a range of sensors to collect data from people living with dementia in unprecedented detail. By integrating robotics and sophisticated data-analytics, 
    this system will provide a test-bed for new approaches to address major care needs and provide personalised healthcare for these individuals.
    The team investigates if the environmental, physiological and behavioural data collected by the Healthy Home can sensitively monitor disease progression and 
    can be used to detect and predict adverse health conditions. They focus on automatic detection of events such as the person becoming agitated, falls, or having sleep disturbances 
    using AI and machine learning solutions. They investigate how machine learning can help identify and predict the specific patterns of those events â€“ and also guide a person towards 
    an appropriate solution, such as improving their hydration or revising their medication.
    The scientists take great care with safeguarding the privacy and security of personal data. 
    They build on their existing 'Databox' system to develop improved ways of storing and analysing data within the home. 
    Although they will allow the limited sharing of data centrally, this will only be after any sensitive information is removed.
