    My research focusses on fast, self-supervised, explainable anomaly detection for sensor data obtained from remote home health 
    monitoring of people living with dementia. The aim is to identify adverse health events and associated digital biomarkers using movement, 
    physiological, environmental and sleep data, to increase the effectiveness of remote health monitoring.
